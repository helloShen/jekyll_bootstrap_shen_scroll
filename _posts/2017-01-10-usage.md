### Usage

All stylesheets are already included in the template.

Use `h3` as the Level 1 title. `h4` as the sub title.

Give each Exercise page a following head:

```bash
layout: post
num: 1
title: Exercise 1
chapter: Chapter 11
description: >
  (2) Create a new class called Gerbil with an int gerbilNumber that’s initialized in the constructor. Give it a method called hop( ) that displays which gerbil number this is, and that it’s hopping. Create an ArrayList and add Gerbil objects to the List. Now use the get( ) method to move through the List and call hop( ) for each Gerbil.
```

Descriptions are recommended to be put in `<blockquote>` tag. If you want the descriptions section can scroll when they are too long, just give the div outside a class `description`, the javascript in template will do it for you.

#### Responsive grid

If you need a responsive column, defind the display rules using `col-xs-x`, `col-sm-x`, `col-md-x`, `col-lg-x` as follow.

```
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 description">
```

The "Hamberger Button" is used to collapse the navigation bar.

```
<button type="button" class="navbar-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-target=".navbar-ex1-collapse">
    <span class="sr-only">Toggle navigation</span>
    <span class="icon-bar"></span>
    <span class="icon-bar"></span>
    <span class="icon-bar"></span>
</button>
```
