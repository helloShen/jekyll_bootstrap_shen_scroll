### What is Jekyll Bootstrap Shen Scroll?

**Jekyll Bootstrap Shen Scroll** is a personal blog Template created for developers who want to
focus on the content instead of waste time on CSS stylesheet.


It merge both the **Jekyll** and **Bootstrap** to generate a static web site. Jekyll is a static blog scaffold, and Bootstrap randering the stylesheet for you.


Write your markdown articles, put them in a folder, and then generate your web site with one command line. And that's all!
