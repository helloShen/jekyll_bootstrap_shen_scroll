#### Jekyll Structure

This template use the simplest Jekyll structure as follow. But since Jekyll is highly scalable, you can expend any module whenever you want.

```bash
├── _config.yml
├── _layouts
|   ├── main.html
|   └── post.html
├── _posts
|   ├── 2007-10-29-your-article-one.md
|   └── 2009-04-26-your-article-two.md
├── _site
├── assets
|   ├── css
|   └── fonts
|   └── js
├── .jekyll-metadata
└── index.html
```

An overview of what each of these does:

* **`_config.yml`**: This is the config file using YAML protocol. Most of the common arguments are included.
* **`_layouts`**: These are the templates that wrap posts. Layouts are chosen on a post-by-post basis in the YAML Front Matter. I initiate only two templates: one for main page, another for posts.
* **`_site`**: This is where the generated site will be placed (by default) once Jekyll is done transforming it. It’s probably a good idea to add this to your ".gitignore" file.
* **`assets`**: This is where I put the Bootstrap. You can see three folders: css,fonts and js.
* **`.jekyll-metadata`**: This is where the generated site will be placed (by default) once Jekyll is done transforming it. It’s probably a good idea to add this to your ".gitignore" file.
* **`index.html`**: The main access of your web site.


#### Liquid Template Language

Jekyll use the **Liquid Template Laguage** to process the markdown files in batches. Here is good online guide for Liquid: [**《Syntax of Liquid Template Language》**](https://github.com/shopify/liquid/wiki/liquid-for-designers)


To create some new Collections like `posts`, just add some add them into the `_config.yml` config file, and create a new directory `_your-new-collection` in the root of your project.

```bash
collections:
  posts:
    output:   true
  your-new-collection:
    output:   true
```
